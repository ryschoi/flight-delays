            <p>For every year except 2020 (due to COVID where travel was all time low), you can see that at least 20% of
                arrivals had some sort of air traffic incident involved whether it be delays, cancellations, or
                divertions. While 20% might not seem super high in a general perspective, considering the number of
                flights that take place on a yearly basis 20% is a considerable issues for the airline industry in the
                US. Not only does this lead to customer dissatisfaction but also leads to immense profit loss within
                companies.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="graph-cont">
            <p class="subheading gray">Arrival Delays By Carrier</p>

                style="width: 100%; height: 715px; zoom: 0.75;"></iframe>
            <p>You can see from the graph that carriers such as Southwest, American, Skywest, and Delta Air almost
                consistently
                on the top every year for most delay data. For airlines like Delta and American that are popular amongst
                individuals it makes sense for their popularity to correlate to the increase in air traffic for their
                company.
                But interestingly enough, these carriers with the most air traffic consumption log have business
                concentrated in
                areas like California, Texas, Illinois, New York, and Florida, all the cities that we saw earlier in our
                choropleth map that had the most concentrated data in delays.</p>

            <img src="graphs/d3_graph.png" width: 100%></img>
            <p>Unsurprisingly, major international hubs like Atlanta (ATL), Chicago O’Hare (ORD), and Dallas-Fort Worth
                (DFW) rank at the top, as these airports handle an enormous volume of flights daily. Interestingly, some
                mid-sized airports also appear in the top 20, likely due to regional congestion or weather-related
                disruptions. The chart reinforces the idea that the busiest airports tend to have the most delays, but
                other factors like geography and airline scheduling inefficiencies also play a significant role in delay
                patterns.</p>

            <iframe src="graphs/Delays by State.html" style="width: 100%; height: 715px; zoom: 0.75;"></iframe>
            <p>As expected, states like California and Texas which are heavily populated and also have major well-known
                airports that serve millions of passengers annually. To our surprise, Illinois is indicated to be the
                4th highest overall delay concentrated state compared to a state like New York. Interestingly enough,
                these states California, Texas, Illinois, and Florida are states with popular national airports but also
                lots of extreme weather conditions which makes sense why these states are delay prone with airflights.

            <p>This is just another contribution towards the choropleth map we made earlier further showing how states
                like Texas, Florida, and California make up 30%+ of delay data alone compared to the other remaining
                states. Looking at the bottom 20 graph, you can see how states that are known to have smaller population
                have low delay data and collectively don’t even make up 20% of delays in the USA. A good amount of these
                states in the top 20 are also tourist attraction spots or areas with popular universities which also
                contribute to more flight delays.</p>

                style="width: 100%; height: 715px; zoom: 0.75;"></iframe>
            <p>California is constantly the number 1 in air traffic except 2020, which is due to covid when
                international regulations tightened for flights, and a huge amount of California flights are
                international. On the other hand, Texas has more domestic travels which is why 2020 there is more air
                traffic. For most other states other than the 4 mentioned in the overall graph, there isn’t much change
                in air traffic throughout the years with exceptions such as North Carolina or Georgia having increases
                in travel for 1 year then going back to their average delay.</p>

            <img src="graphs/Total Arrival Delay Minutes by Region.png" width: 100%></img>
            <p>We can see that similar to the low correlation in the heatmap, security delay doesn’t even make up 10% of
                recorded delays for any region. Interestingly though, the weather doesn’t seem too big of a contributor
                just based off this stacked bar chart. The Midwest and West Coast have the biggest stacks for weather
                which makes sense as these areas of America have states with more extreme weather conditions. Similar to
                the heatmap results, carrier, NAS, and late aircraft delays make up approximately 80% of all delay data
                for each region. This further proves that operational efficiencies like scheduling, maintenance, and
                carrier management are the biggest issues that contribute delays nationwide and this is a big issue
                especially in the West coast as seen through the tallest bar within this chart.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="graph-cont">
            <p class="subheading gray">Correlation HeatMap between Arrival Delays and Causes of Delays</p>
            <img src="graphs/Correlation HeatMap between Arrival Delays and Causes of Delays.png" width: 100%></img>
            <p>We see when comparing air delay (minutes) to other specific delay features, the correlation between late
                aircraft is 0.96, carrier is 0.94, NAS 0.86, weather 0.77, and security 0.38. While it seems security
                doesn’t have much impact on airline delays, it seems that features like weather and NAS have a
                moderately high contribution towards higher delay times. Late aircrafts have 0.96 correlation to arrival
                delays which indicates that late delays from previous flights have a huge impact on arrival delays.
                These results suggest that while airline control factors like carrier and aircrafts have the most
                significant affect towards delay increases, systemic issues like traffic congestion weather conditions
                also have almost as significant impact. This indicates the fact that several adjustments are required
                for improvement whether it be operational improvements, air traffic management, enhanced weather
                forecasting strategies, etc. </p>

                style="width: 100%; height: 410px; zoom: 1.25;"></iframe>
            <p>You could also see there is an outlier of 2020 which is because of COVID where air travel regulations
                were strict and economic activity was at an all-time low. There is notable clustering of data within the
                upper right side of the data which indicates that though not for every increase in delay count, higher
                delay counts generally lead to moderate high income. This was interesting because initially we had 100%
                expected income levels to drop as more delays typically would be expected to drop income levels.
                However, thinking in a broader economic perspective, more delays leads to the fact that there is lots of
                air traffic which means strong economic activity. Even though there might be so many delays that could
                lead to income loss, these datapoints suggest that high economic activity sort of outweighs those losses
                from delays. </p>

    <p class="subheading gray">SUMMARY OF FINDINGS</p>
    <p>
        After analyzing flight delays and their causes, we uncovered some interesting patterns. One major takeaway is
        that American Airlines and Southwest Airlines had the most arrival delays, while JetBlue, Delta, and United had
        significantly fewer. This shows that choosing certain airlines over others might make a difference if people
        want to avoid delays. We also found that Florida, California, and Texas had the highest number of arrival delays
        and delays per minute. This makes sense given that they are the 3 most populated states. However, this dataset
        alone isn’t likely to change passenger behavior, as people will continue flying to these major hubs regardless
        of potential delays. On the other end of the spectrum, states like Alabama, New Mexico, and Nebraska had the
        lowest share of arrival delays, reinforcing the idea that larger, busier states tend to experience more
        disruptions.

        <br /><br />One surprising finding was that New York didn’t rank among the top states for delays, even though
        it’s the fourth most populated state and home to New York City. Our D3 visualization showed NYC as one of the
        most delayed airports, yet our heatmap of state-level delays didn’t reflect the same trend. This suggests that
        delays in New York may be concentrated at specific airports rather than being a statewide issue. The same could
        be applied to Illinois as well as we found that Chicago had the most delays but Illinois didn’t come out as the
        most delayed city.

        <br /><br />To help reduce delays, airports in high-delay areas might consider upgrading air traffic management
        systems or expanding runway capacity to handle growing demand. On the passenger side, travelers can choose less
        busy airports or book flights during off-peak hours to reduce the risk of delays. Looking ahead, future research
        could dig deeper into seasonal trends, weather impacts, and peak travel periods to provide more specific
        insights. Using machine learning models to predict delays based on past data could help airlines and airports
        prepare for disruptions before they happen. Expanding the dataset to cover international flights and a longer
        period could also give a more complete picture of flight delay trends.
