                    (DFW) rank at the top, as these airports handle an enormous volume of flights daily. Interestingly,
                    some
                    mid-sized airports also appear in the top 20, likely due to regional congestion or weather-related
                    disruptions. The chart reinforces the idea that the busiest airports tend to have the most delays,
                    but
                    other factors like geography and airline scheduling inefficiencies also play a significant role in

                    population
                    have low delay data and collectively don’t even make up 20% of delays in the USA. A good amount of

                    international regulations tightened for flights, and a huge amount of California flights are
                    international. On the other hand, Texas has more domestic travels which is why 2020 there is more

                <p class="subheading">Reasons for flight delays, by region</p>
                <p class="gray">This is a stacked bar chart of different reasons for or types of flight delays, separated by geographical region in the US. We can see that similar to the low correlation in the heatmap, security delay doesn’t
                    even make up 10% of
                    recorded delays for any region. Interestingly though, the weather doesn’t seem too big of a
                    contributor
                    just based off this stacked bar chart. The Midwest and West Coast have the biggest stacks for
                    weather
                    which makes sense as these areas of America have states with more extreme weather conditions.
                    Similar to
                    the heatmap results, carrier, NAS, and late aircraft delays make up approximately 80% of all delay
                    data
                    for each region. This further proves that operational efficiencies like scheduling, maintenance, and
                    carrier management are the biggest issues that contribute delays nationwide and this is a big issue
                    especially in the West coast as seen through the tallest bar within this chart.</p>

                <p class="gray">This is a heatmap of the correlation between the different causes of delays. We see when comparing air delay (minutes) to other specific delay features, the
                    correlation between late
                    aircraft is 0.96, carrier is 0.94, NAS 0.86, weather 0.77, and security 0.38. While it seems
                    security
                    doesn’t have much impact on airline delays, it seems that features like weather and NAS have a
                    moderately high contribution towards higher delay times. Late aircrafts have 0.96 correlation to
                    arrival
                    delays which indicates that late delays from previous flights have a huge impact on arrival delays.
                    These results suggest that while airline control factors like carrier and aircrafts have the most
                    significant affect towards delay increases, systemic issues like traffic congestion weather
                    conditions
                    also have almost as significant impact. This indicates the fact that several adjustments are
                    required
                    for improvement whether it be operational improvements, air traffic management, enhanced weather
                    forecasting strategies, etc. </p>

                <p class="gray">This is a scatter plot of the relationship between the number of delayed flights and the total US income. You could also see there is an outlier of 2020 which is because of COVID where air
                    travel regulations
                    were strict and economic activity was at an all-time low. There is notable clustering of data within
                    the
                    upper right side of the data which indicates that though not for every increase in delay count,
                    higher
                    delay counts generally lead to moderate high income. This was interesting because initially we had
                    100%
                    expected income levels to drop as more delays typically would be expected to drop income levels.
                    However, thinking in a broader economic perspective, more delays leads to the fact that there is
                    lots of
                    air traffic which means strong economic activity. Even though there might be so many delays that
                    could
                    lead to income loss, these datapoints suggest that high economic activity sort of outweighs those
                    losses
                    from delays. </p>

    <div class="about-item">
        <p class="subheading">Summary of findings</p>
        <p class="gray">
            After analyzing flight delays and their causes, we uncovered some interesting patterns. One major takeaway is that American Airlines and Southwest Airlines had the most arrival delays, while JetBlue, Delta, and United had significantly fewer. This shows that choosing certain airlines over others might make a difference if people want to avoid delays. We also found that Florida, California, and Texas had the highest number of arrival delays and delays per minute. This makes sense given that they are the 3 most populated states. However, this dataset alone isn’t likely to change passenger behavior, as people will continue flying to these major hubs regardless of potential delays. On the other end of the spectrum, states like Alabama, New Mexico, and Nebraska had the lowest share of arrival delays, reinforcing the idea that larger, busier states tend to experience more disruptions.
    
            <br /><br />One surprising finding was that New York didn’t rank among the top states for delays, even though it’s the fourth most populated state and home to New York City. Our D3 visualization showed NYC as one of the most delayed airports, yet our heatmap of state-level delays didn’t reflect the same trend. This suggests that delays in New York may be concentrated at specific airports rather than being a statewide issue. The same could be applied to Illinois as well as we found that Chicago had the most delays but Illinois didn’t come out as the most delayed city. 

    
            <br /><br />To help reduce delays, airports in high-delay areas might consider upgrading air traffic management systems or expanding runway capacity to handle growing demand. On the passenger side, travelers can choose less busy airports or book flights during off-peak hours to reduce the risk of delays. Looking ahead, future research could dig deeper into seasonal trends, weather impacts, and peak travel periods to provide more specific insights. Using machine learning models to predict delays based on past data could help airlines and airports prepare for disruptions before they happen. Expanding the dataset to cover international flights and a longer period could also give a more complete picture of flight delay trends.
