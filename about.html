            <p class="subheading">Topic Introduction</p>
            <p class="gray">The topic we will explore for this project is air traffic, precisely data revolving around
                US Domestic flights from various cities and delays. We chose this topic because air travel is a highly
                regulated industry with lots of variables to explore. Furthermore, we all love to travel but have had a
                couple of bad experiences waiting in the airport with delays. Therefore we thought itâ€™ll be a very
                interesting topic where we could dive further into. As for the data set, because people are traveling
                all day every day every year, there are likely lots of patterns that could be drawn out of air traffic
                data, which we wanted to translate into simple and informative visualizations.

        <!-- Data -->
        <div class="about-item">
            <p class="subheading">Data</p>
            <p class="gray">This dataset contains flight performance data for many different airlines and from years between 2013 - 2023. Some of these flight carriers include ones that we have flown with  in the past including Jet Blue, Delta, American, and United. The dataset includes arrival statistics across multiple airports, detailing the number of flights, delays, cancellations, and diversions. The dataset tracks various causes of delays, such as carrier-related, weather, National Airspace System, security, and late aircraft delays. It consists of attributes such as the airport name, flight counts, delay durations, and disruption counts. This data is valuable for analyzing airline punctuality, identifying delay patterns, and assessing operational efficiency.
